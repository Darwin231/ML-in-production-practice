# ML-in-production-practice
Machine Learning models in production practice with Python and FastAPI 

*Project for practical purposes*

## 1. Objective

The main objective of this project is creating a template for web MLOps.

## 2. How it works?

#### 2.1 Data

The model was trainned with the iris data set from sklearn

#### 3.2 Project structure

The structure is going to be breakdown into to steps: Model creation and Model Deployment

##### 3.2.1 Model Creation

For this project, the model was trainned with a simple logistic regresion with Grid Search to find the best parameterts, applying the variance inflation factor a method to analyze the correlation between variables as a feature importance.

##### 3.2.2 Model Deployment
